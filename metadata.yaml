description: <p>"In a few short pages," writes Francine Prose in her Introduction,
  "May Sinclair succeeds in rendering the oppressive weight and strength of the chains
  of family love." Young Harriett Frean is taught that "behaving beautifully" is paramount,
  and she becomes a self-sacrificing woman whose choices prove devastating to herself
  and to those who love her most. An early pioneer of<br>stream-of-consciousness writing,
  Sinclair employs the technique brilliantly in this finely crafted psychological
  novel. Evoking the style and depth of her contemporaries Virginia Woolf and D. H.
  Lawrence, Sinclair's haunting narrative also reflects her keen interest in the theories
  of Jung and Freud. The text of this Modern Library 20th Century Rediscovery was
  set from the first American edition of 1922.<br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback
  edition.</i>
